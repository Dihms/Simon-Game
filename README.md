This is a Simon Game I built while learning JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I originally developed it in July 2024 as a fun project to solidify my understanding of frontend web development.

I uploaded it to this repository to practice my Git skills and get more comfortable with using Git commands for version control.

Feel free to explore the code, play the game, and provide feedback!
